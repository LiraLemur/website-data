## About Us

Centralized control of economies presents a profound temptation to benefit only a small group of people, at the expense of sustainable development.

We believe that economies should be decentralized, yet rational. The Sora Decentralized Autonomous Economy (DAE) is the world's first decentralized economy, where everyone participates to create the best world together.

[Soramitsu](https://soramitsu.co.jp/), founded by [Makoto Takemiya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/makoto-takemiya/) and [Ryu Okada](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryu-okada-69080628/), is building Sora with the aim to create a new type of economic system to improve the efficiency of society.

"Let's create a new society around empowerment, democratization, and collaboration."

-Makoto Takemiya, Co-CEO of Soramitsu"

## How the Sora Ecosystem Works

### EMPOWERMENT

Project producers build products and services in the Sora Economy.

### DEMOCRATIZATION

Sora users vote on which projects should be allocated newly created tokens.

### COLLABORATION

Everyone benefits when new tokens are created for the best uses. The community collaborates on choosing the best projects and most skilled teams to produce them.
