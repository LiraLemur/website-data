## Header

Soramitsu is a blockchain technology company based in Japan. We are focusing on developing a digital identity platform for blockchains.

## Hyperedger Iroha

Hyperledger Iroha is a next-generation permissioned blockchain platform, aimed at helping businesses and financial institutions manage digital assets. Soramitsu was the original developer of Hyperledger Iroha and contributed it to the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Project. Hyperledger Iroha is written in C++, making it ideal for use cases where high performance and reliability are needed, or for embedded systems.

Soramitsu uses Hyperledger Iroha to create services for users, including mobile applications for managing digital assets, identity, and contracts. Through our use of Hyperledger Iroha, we hope to contribute to a safer and more efficient society.

## Digital Identity

Identity is at the base of all financial applications in the digital economy. Having a convenient and secure way to share personal information, validate it, and prove your identity in a digital environment is the key to creating safe, decentralized applications, that give users control over their own information.

## Sora

Sora is a decentralized autonomous economy, where new XOR tokens are created to empower the creating of new goods and services.

Sora (XOR) is a utility token that powers the Sora ecosystem. Premium functions in the Sora identity application take advantage of the Sora token and the token will work to power our comprehensive ecosystem.

There is no ICO, but Sora token will be distributed soon. Keep in touch!

## Digital Assets

Soramitsu is the original creator of Hyperledger Iroha and has deep understanding of blockchain technology and also how to make user applications that can take full advantage of blockchain. One of the most common use cases for blockchain is the management of digital assets, such as currencies, points, or any kind of countable asset.

## Case studies

### Kagome

Kagome is a C ++  implementation of the Polkadot Runtime Environment developed by Soramitsu and funded by a Web3 Foundation grant. With Kagome, all Soramitsu projects can be connected to blockchains supporting Polkadot, thus becoming a part of the next-generation decentralized web.

### Digital Identity

Identity is the key to the most important doors in our lives - people we know, communities we belong to. It is also true for many services we use every day - we confirm our identity in the bank, in governmental institutions etc. Each and every one of them holds information about us, based on Know Your Customer regulations.

What Soramitsu offers to the businesses is the solution for secure sharing of the confirmed identity between companies or the group of companies based on the Hyperledger Iroha DLT. That way, companies do not need to perform KYC procedures in every company, while still having the proof of the identity without leaking any sensitive personal data."

### D3 Ledger

Soramitsu and the central securities depositories of Slovenia ([KDD](https://www-en.kdd.si)) and Russia ([National Settlement Repository of Moscow Exchange Group](https://www.nsd.ru/en/)) are collaborating on [D3, the Decentralized Digital Despoitory](https://d3ledger.com). This is a token issuance and post-trade settlement infrastructure for financial institutions to use to provide custodian, asset creation, OTC trades, and settlement services to their users.

### Cambodian Payment System

Soramitsu and the National Bank of Cambodia are working to co-develop the open source distributed ledger (blockchain) project Hyperledger Iroha.

Through a co-development agreement, the National Bank of Cambodia will study the implications of distributed ledger technology, while contributing to the open source development of Hyperledger Iroha and developing new payment infrastructures.

### Moeka

Working with the University of Tokyo, University of Aizu, and International University of Japan GLOCOM, we performed an experiment in Aizu, Japan, where new units of a currency created for an event were created through social interaction between people at the event.

People working together in society has tremendous value and the Moeka experiment showed a way to use blockchain technology to allow the quantification of this value.

### Byacco

Byacco is a local, digital currency for the University of Aizu. Based on mobile apps, users can simply send money to each other instantly. On campus, this currency was tested in the University of Aizu store and cafeteria. A production version of this system is now under development and will debut soon.
